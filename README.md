I created this project when I was looking for a new job. 
I wanted a web page to showcase my CV in several languages, and I wanted it to be easy to update.
That's why I decided to use React with the i18next library â€“ I store all the content in JSON files.
If I need to add a new job or skill, I can do it directly in the JSON file.
